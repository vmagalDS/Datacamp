## Practical Exam - Recipe Site Traffic

This is a practical exam for [Data Scientist Certificate](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DS0027715087490) (previously Data Scientist Professional Certificate). 
The goal was to analyse whether a recipe published on a website will be popular or not.
The popular recipes lead to a higher traffic of a web site which increases the number of subscriptions.

## Task and Dataset
Here you can find a [task](https://github.com/vmagalDS/Datacamp/blob/main/DataScienceExam/Practical%20Recipe%20Site%20Traffic%202212.pdf)

Here are the [data](https://github.com/vmagalDS/Datacamp/blob/main/DataScienceExam/recipe_site_traffic_2212.csv)

## Solution
The [solution](https://github.com/vmagalDS/Datacamp/blob/main/DataScienceExam/Exam%20Recipe.ipynb) has been written using python.

# Data Science Track
## Data Management
Getting data from a range of appropriate sources and resolving data issues, such as formats, handling missing data, reshaping and joining, and validating data.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
Using standard manipulation and visualization techniques to learn more about the data available and insights that may be gained. Preparing data for further analysis and modeling including the creation of new features.
Visualisation with matplotlib and seaborn
## Statistics
Using data and relevant statistical approaches to perform experiments.
## Model Development
Developing predictive models using appropriate machine learning techniques for the data and task at hand. Performing all elements of the model development workflow from initial fit to model validation and parameter tuning.
## Coding for Production Environments
Being able to write reusable code to solve data problems. Identifying when problems have occurred and resolved them effectively, ultimately resulting in a process suitable for production environments for solving data challenges.
## Communication and Reporting
Presenting data in reports or dashboards to make available to stakeholders and clearly presenting actionable analytic results to business problems.

## Skills
- Python programming, Data Manipulation with pandas, joining, grouping, functions, importing data etc.
- Statistics (distributions, sampling, hypothesis testing)
- Supervised Learning (Classification, Regression, fine-tuning etc.), Preprocessing, Pipelines, Unsupervised Learing (Clustering, -SNE , Dimension Reduction etc.)
